The C programming language 
provides many standard library functions 
for file input and output. 
These functions 
make up the bulk of the C standard 
library header <stdio.h>. 
The functionality descends from a "portable I/O package" 
written by Mike Lesk at Bell Labs in the early 1970s, 
and officially became part of the Unix operating system in Version 7.
